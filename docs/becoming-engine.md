# THE BECOMING ENGINE

## Practical Operating Manual (Personal + Org Nodes)

---

## 0. What This System Is (in one paragraph)

This is a **cybernetic regulation system**, not a productivity or planning system.

Its job is **not** to decide what you should achieve.

Its job is to:

- keep you viable
- prevent collapse
- allow learning without coercion
- preserve agency and optionality
- disappear when nothing is wrong

If the system is “busy,” something is off.

---

## 1. Core Objects (Non-Negotiable)

The system recognizes **only** these concepts:

### Variables

Dimensions of viability. Not optimized. Regulated only when drifting.

Personal examples:

- Continuity
- Agency
- Optionality
- Social Embeddedness

Org examples:

- Execution Capacity
- Coherence
- Runway
- Learning Velocity

---

### Episodes

**Temporary interventions**. The _only_ place where authority exists.

Two types:

- **Stabilize** – restore safety
- **Explore** – reduce uncertainty via learning

Episodes:

- are time-bounded
- must fit on the whiteboard
- must be closeable
- never define identity

---

### Actions

Concrete behaviors.

Two kinds:

- **Episode-scoped Actions**: linked to an Episode (carry temporary authority while the Episode is active)
- **Unscoped Actions**: allowed without an Episode (carry **zero authority**; never become a backlog)

- 1–3 per Episode (for episode-scoped actions)
- Disposable
- Unscoped actions are never treated as “next actions” or used to generate plans

---

### Notes

Raw thoughts, ideas, worries.

- Zero authority
- Can be erased freely
- Never drive action directly

---

## 2. Nodes (Critical Separation)

You operate **two separate organisms**:

### 🧠 Personal Node

- Regulates _you_
- Conservative
- Prioritizes stability and safety

### 🏗 Org Node

- Regulates the Org
- Allowed to be exploratory and messy
- Has its _own_ Episodes

**Rule:**

> Personal Episodes regulate the person.
>
> Org Episodes regulate the Org.
>
> Interface Actions regulate neither.

---

## 3. Physical Implementation (Whiteboards)

### You MUST have two boards.

### Personal Board (≈ 2×3 ft)

Purpose: _Are you okay?_

Contains:

- Variables
- Personal Episodes
- Pressure notes

Should feel:

- sparse
- quiet
- boring

---

### Org Board (≈ 3×4 ft or larger)

Purpose: _What is the Org doing or learning?_

Contains:

- Org Variables
- Org Episodes
- Org Actions (inside Episodes)

Allowed to be:

- messy
- active
- ambitious

---

## 4. Rules for Episodes (Very Important)

### Explore Episodes

- **Max: 1 per node**
- Hypothesis-driven
- Learning is the success condition
- Must end with a belief update

If learning does not occur → Episode failed → close it.

---

### Stabilize Episodes

- Multiple allowed **per node**
- **Max: 1 active per Variable** (policy-configurable)
- Must be tiny and boring
- No growth, leverage, or ambition
- Goal: _reduce pressure_, not improve life

If it requires success to work → it is NOT stabilizing.

---

## 5. What Goes on a Whiteboard (Exactly)

### A valid Episode must fit in 6–10 handwritten lines.

Structure:

```
TYPE –Variable(s)
Hypothesis (1 sentence)
Actions (1–3 max)
Ends when: (clear condition)

```

If it doesn’t fit → it’s not a valid Episode.

---

## 6. Actions (Hard Rules)

- ❌ No standalone action lists
- ❌ No backlogs
- ❌ No “next action” logic
- ✅ Episode-scoped Actions only exist inside Episodes
- ✅ Episode-scoped Actions disappear when Episodes close (they stop being authoritative/surfaced)
- ✅ Unscoped Actions may exist, but they must remain low-authority and non-surfaced

If you feel the urge to track actions → pressure is rising.

---

## 7. Baseline vs Intervention

### Baseline State (Success)

- No Episodes open
- You act freely
- No justification required
- No tracking

### Out of Baseline

Triggered by:

- urgency
- optimization pressure
- feeling trapped
- needing certainty

Response:

- Open **minimal** Stabilize Episodes
- Reduce authority
- Shorten time horizons

---

## 8. Continuity Work (Clarified)

**Continuity work is allowed background activity with zero authority.**

It:

- keeps skills warm
- preserves identity continuity
- does NOT aim to fix anything

Examples:

- touching music without release pressure
- refactoring existing org material
- organizing archives
- documentation

**Test:**

If you stopped for two weeks and nothing breaks → it qualifies.

Continuity work:

- does NOT go on whiteboards as Episodes
- may be noted briefly as “allowed background activity”

---

## 9. Interface Rules (Personal ↔ Org)

You may:

- perform Org Actions while a Personal Explore is open
- contribute labor freely

You may NOT:

- let Org outcomes regulate your emotions
- use Org success as personal stabilization
- treat Org failure as personal failure

**Test:**

“If the Org stalls, am I still okay?”

If no → boundary violation → pause Org exploration.

---

## 10. Crisis Protocol (Read This Carefully)

### True crisis = loss of basic functioning or safety.

In crisis:

- **Suspend all Explore Episodes**
- **Allow only Stabilize actions**
- **Block irreversible decisions**
- **Seek external support immediately**

This is not system failure.

This is correct escalation.

If you are in the U.S., you can call or text **988** for immediate support. If elsewhere, ask and I’ll help find resources.

---

## 11. Common Situations & What To Do

### “I feel pressure to optimize or choose the right path”

→ You are out of baseline

→ Open Stabilize Episode

→ Shorten horizon

→ Remove authority

---

### “I want to work on music/org while unstable”

→ Allowed as **interface actions or continuity work**

→ Not allowed as stabilizers

---

### “My board feels crowded”

→ Too many Episodes

→ Merge or close

→ Erase, don’t reorganize

---

### “I want to build software”

→ Only after whiteboards feel boring

→ Software removes friction, never adds authority

→ If you could throw it away tomorrow, it’s okay

---

## 12. Weekly / Daily Use (Lightweight)

### Daily (1 minute)

- Glance at Personal Variables
- Ask: “Am I in baseline?”
- If yes → ignore system
- If no → minimal stabilization

### Weekly (5–10 minutes)

- Close any Episodes that can close
- Erase Notes
- Ask: “Is anything leaking?”

No reviews. No planning.

---

## 13. The Fundamental Guarantee

> You are not required to optimize your life.
>
> You are required only to remain viable.
>
> Learning happens when pressure is low enough to allow it.
>
> When nothing is wrong, the system disappears.

---

## Final Instruction (This Matters)

If you ever feel confused using the system, apply this rule:

> Reduce authority. Reduce scope. Erase something.

That will always move you back toward baseline.
