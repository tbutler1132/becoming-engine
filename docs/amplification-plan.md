## Amplification Plan (Quiet, Artifact-Driven)

This plan is for "building in public" without turning the project into optimization theater. The core idea: **publish artifacts**, not constant narration.

---

## Start Here (Literal First Steps)

### This Week (close current Episode)

If you have an active Personal Explore Episode (e.g., "mess around with the system"), finish and close it first.

**1. Continue current work**

- Feature work, playing with the system, whatever you're doing.

**2. Friday: close the Episode with learning (15 min)**

- Capture what you learned:
  - "System is usable (CLI + Web UI work)"
  - "Gap found: can't add Variables from UI"
  - "Amplification plan written"
- Close the Episode in the system.

---

### Next Monday (Week 1 of amplification)

**3. Personal node check (5 min)**

- Open the system (CLI or UI).
- Glance at your Personal Variables.
- Confirm any active Stabilize Episodes are still running.
- Ask: "If the Org stalls, am I still okay?" If yes → proceed.

**4. Spin up the Org node (10 min)**

- Create or confirm your Org node exists in the system.
- Add 3–5 Org Variables (start with: Runway, Execution Capacity, Pipeline, Coherence, Learning Velocity).
- Set their initial status (even "Unknown" is fine).

**5. Open your first Org Explore Episode (15 min)**

- Episode: **"Release Single v1 (Luxury Accessible Pop)"**
- Hypothesis: "If I ship one polished single with pro collaborators, I learn what creates a step-change in perceived quality."
- Add 1–3 Actions (Gate 0):
  - Write 1-page creative brief + pick 3 reference tracks.
  - Set budget ceiling ($30k) + freeze points.
  - Draft producer/topliner outreach message.

**6. First amplification artifact (30 min)**

- Write a short "What I'm building" post (2–3 paragraphs) announcing the Becoming Engine + the single as first flagship project.
- Publish to one channel (X/Bluesky, blog, or newsletter).
- This is your "Episode opened" signal—not a content treadmill.

### By end of Week 1

**7. Complete Gate 0 (single)**

- Finalize and send the 1-page brief + refs to producer shortlist.
- Lock budget ceiling + freeze points in writing.

**8. First closure artifact (when Gate 0 closes)**

- Write a short "Gate 0 closed" note: what's locked, what's next, what you learned.
- Publish (same channel as #6).

---

### Ongoing rhythm (Weeks 2–8)

- **Daily (1 min)**: Personal check. If baseline → ignore system.
- **Weekly (10–15 min)**: Org check-in + Episode review. Pull next 1–3 Actions. Capture learning.
- **On closure**: Publish artifact (closure note, gate note, or the single itself).
- **Default cadence**: ~1 published artifact per week is plenty. If you're posting more, something is off.

---

### How to use this doc

This is a single integrated plan, not separate tracks:

- **Personal node**: stays viable, regulates you (daily glance, minimal Episodes).
- **Org node**: regulates your creative/business organism (weekly check-in, bounded Episodes, explicit learning).
- **Amplification**: happens on closures (artifacts published episodically, not constantly).
- **Flagship projects** (e.g., the music single): are Org-node Explore Episodes that also serve as high-leverage amplification artifacts.

Run the Personal check first. Then run the Org. Then publish what you learned. Repeat.

---

## Business Viability Layer (Org Node)

The Org node is a separate organism. It regulates **your creative business**, not you.

### When to spin up the Org node

You need an Org node when:

- You're doing work that has its own viability concerns (revenue, collaborators, releases, reputation).
- You want to pursue ambition without letting it destabilize your Personal baseline.
- You have at least one project worth treating as an "organism" (the single qualifies).

If everything is still personal exploration with no external stakes, stay in Personal only.

### Org node Variables (what to regulate)

Start with 3–5 Variables that capture "is the Org viable?" Not goals—dimensions of health:

- **Runway**: how long can you operate without new revenue? (e.g., months of buffer)
- **Execution Capacity**: can you actually ship? (bandwidth, energy, collaborator availability)
- **Pipeline / Revenue**: is there income or realistic near-term income?
- **Coherence**: does the output feel like one thing? (brand clarity, narrative consistency)
- **Learning Velocity**: are you getting smarter about what works? (explicit Models accumulating)

You don't optimize these. You regulate them: notice when one drifts, intervene minimally, return to baseline.

### Org node Episodes

Same rules as Personal:

- **Stabilize**: restore a Variable to range (e.g., "Runway is low → pause new spend until invoice clears").
- **Explore**: reduce uncertainty via learning (e.g., "Ship single → learn what moves the needle for this sound").
- Max 1 active Explore per node.
- Max 1 active Stabilize per Variable.

### Interface rules (Personal ↔ Org)

From the Operating Manual:

- You may perform Org Actions while a Personal Explore is open.
- You may NOT let Org outcomes regulate your emotions.
- You may NOT use Org success as personal stabilization.
- **Test**: "If the Org stalls, am I still okay?" If no → boundary violation → pause Org exploration.

---

## Operating Rhythm (Daily / Weekly)

### Personal node (daily, 1 minute)

- Glance at Personal Variables.
- Ask: "Am I in baseline?"
- If yes → ignore system.
- If no → minimal Stabilize Episode (tiny, boring, no ambition).

### Org node (weekly, 10–15 minutes)

- Check Org Variables: Runway, Execution Capacity, Pipeline, Coherence, Learning Velocity.
- Review active Episodes: still on track? need to close? need to scope down?
- Pull next 1–3 Actions only if needed (no backlog).
- Capture any explicit learning (Models).

### Amplification (on closure, not on schedule)

- When a microproject or Episode closes, publish a closure artifact.
- Default cadence: ~1 artifact per week is plenty.
- If you're posting more than that, something is off.

---

## How the Single Fits In

The music single is your **first Org-node Explore Episode** and your **first flagship amplification artifact**.

- **Org-side**: it tests the hypothesis "If I invest in one luxury single with pro collaborators, I learn what creates a step-change in perceived quality."
- **Amplification-side**: the release + closure note become public artifacts that prove the system works for real creative output.
- **Personal-side**: you stay regulated separately. If Personal drifts during production, pause Org exploration.

This is not "do the single instead of the project." It's: **use the system to ship the single, and let the single prove the system.**

### Goals

- **Make the philosophy legible** to curious people (non-technical included).
- **Make the system tangible** (what it looks like in use, what “baseline quiet” means).
- **Attract the right collaborators** (people aligned with restraint, clarity, and constraints).
- **Preserve viability** (no hype treadmill; no privacy leaks; no scope capture).

### Non-Goals

- **Not** growth hacking, daily posting, “shipping for engagement,” or building a SaaS funnel.
- **Not** collecting user data to prove traction.
- **Not** optimizing for virality at the expense of doctrine.

---

## Operating Principles (Doctrine-Aligned)

- **Baseline is quiet**: if you’re posting constantly, something is off. Publish on closures.
- **Episodic updates**: ship in bounded microprojects (Explore Episodes) and share closure artifacts.
- **Explicit learning**: every meaningful change should produce a clear “what we learned / what we now believe.”
- **Anti-capture**: no coercive mechanics, no pressure narratives, no “grind” mythology.
- **Privacy-by-default**: never share real personal state; use synthetic datasets for screenshots and demos.
- **Configure boundaries, not mechanisms**: share constraints and invariants; don’t over-index on implementation trivia.

---

## Audiences (Keep It Simple)

- **You (primary user)**: the tool must remain usable for your real life.
- **Curious readers (secondary)**: want the philosophy + a tangible demo; do not want npm setup.
- **Potential contributors (tertiary)**: want clear contracts, scope boundaries, and acceptance criteria.

---

## The Artifact Ladder (What to Publish)

Publish from the top down. Each rung should stand alone.

### Rung 0: Philosophy (yes—blogs count)

If the target audience is “me + curious people,” then **writing is a primary artifact**, not a side quest.

- **Short essays / blog posts**: 800–2000 words on a single claim (e.g., “Baseline is the goal,” “Why Episodes must close”).
- **Doctrine clarifications**: when you notice a pattern of confusion, update wording and publish the delta.
- **Case studies**: “Here’s a real Episode we ran (sanitized), what happened, what we learned.”

Rule: write like a manual, not a manifesto—**legibility over persuasion**.

### Rung 1: Zero-Install (for curious readers)

- **Guided demo** (read-only, synthetic data): “here’s baseline,” “here’s drift,” “here’s an Episode closing with learning.”
- **Short tour doc**: a 5–10 minute walkthrough with screenshots/GIFs.
- **One-page “What this is / isn’t”**: cybernetic regulation, not planning/productivity.

### Rung 2: Readable Core (for committed readers)

- **Doctrine**: keep `docs/doctrine.md` as the north star.
- **Operating Manual**: keep `docs/operating-manual.md` as the “how to use it without software” artifact.
- **Tech Spec**: keep `docs/tech-spec.md` as the formal contract (what exists; what doesn’t).

### Rung 3: Proof It Runs (for technical curiosity)

- **Release notes**: a small, crisp “what changed / why / how to try.”
- **Changelog** (optional): if Releases feel too heavy, keep a simple running log.
- **Repro scripts**: “run these 3 commands to see the loop.”

### Rung 4: Stewardship (for contributors)

- **Microproject issues** (from `docs/dev_workflow.md`): goal, hypothesis, acceptance, scope boundary.
- **ADRs / decisions** (already in `docs/decisions/`): publish when a choice closes a branch.
- **Interfaces first**: when adding modules/plugins, publish the public API contract early.

---

## Recommended Channels (Low Maintenance)

Pick 1–2 primary channels. Everything else should link back to a canonical artifact.

- **Canonical home**: GitHub repo (README + `docs/`).
- **Release surface**: GitHub Releases (or a pinned “What’s new” doc).
- **Broadcast** (choose one): a short-form channel (e.g. X/Bluesky) _or_ a long-form channel (blog/newsletter).
- **Discovery spikes** (optional): Hacker News / Reddit _only_ when you have a real demo + crisp framing.

Rule: **don’t create more surfaces than you can keep quiet and current**.

---

## Cadence (Episodic, Not Daily)

### Default rhythm

- **Publish only on closure**:
  - microproject complete
  - meaningful doctrine clarification
  - demo milestone (UI loop becomes usable)

### Suggested frequency

- **1 artifact post per microproject**, not per commit.
- If you want a steady drumbeat: **1 “closure note” per week** is plenty.

---

## “Minimum Amplification Pack” (Start Here)

If you publish nothing else, publish these 4 artifacts:

- **A demo that runs in a browser** (read-only, synthetic)
- **A 5–10 minute guided tour doc**
- **A single “Start here” path** (README → doctrine → operating manual → demo)
- **A first release note** describing the viable loop and what’s intentionally missing

Optional (high leverage if you like writing):

- **A single “Why this exists” essay** that matches the doctrine tone (quiet, bounded, non-mythic).

## Safety & Privacy Checklist (Before You Publish)

- **No real state**: never screenshot or publish `data/state.json` containing personal content.
- **Synthetic demo dataset**: maintain a separate demo state file with fake IDs/content.
- **Redaction**: assume screenshots leak more than you think (names, dates, tags, objectives).
- **No identity hooks**: avoid framing like “this will fix your life” or “become your best self.”
- **No nag UX**: don’t describe features that imply pressure (“streaks,” “daily goals,” “overdue”).

---

## How You’ll Know It’s Working (Without Getting Captured)

Use quiet indicators, not dopamine metrics:

- People say: “I understand it now,” “I tried it on a whiteboard,” “this removed pressure.”
- A few high-quality issues/PRs that respect scope and constraints.
- The repo remains **healthy** (`npm run check` stays green) and **legible** (docs stay current).

---

## Suggested First Public “Episode”

If you want a clean first wave:

- **Episode**: “Make the system instantly understandable to a stranger.”
- **Ship**: demo + tour doc + start-here path.
- **Close with learning**: what confused people, what language worked, what the UI made tangible.

---

## Example: Shipping a Music Single as an Org-Node Artifact

If your first “powerful artifact” is a legit, well-produced, marketed single: great. That’s exactly the kind of thing that can prove the system is not just software.

### How to model it (doctrine-aligned)

- **Put it in the Org node**: the single is an Org organism outcome. Keep Personal separate.
- **Use one Explore Episode at a time**: treat the single as an Explore Episode: reduce uncertainty and produce explicit learning.
- **Keep Actions tiny (1–3 at a time)**: don’t pre-load a backlog; pull the next 1–3 Actions only when needed.

### Concrete plan (based on an actual first single)

This is a template you can copy directly for a “high-investment, luxury” first single:

- **Budget**: ~$30k
- **Tempo / key**: ~123 BPM, F minor
- **Aesthetic**: baroque/cinematic maximalism with pop clarity (“MBDTF-scale polish”)
- **Strings**: live (small section recorded well)
- **Vocals**:
  - primary lead: male pop singer (session)
  - halo: classically trained but pop-controlled female vocalist (session; texture + lift, not featured)
- **Subtext**: mostly felt (no overt lore-dumping in v1)
- **String placement**:
  - bridge: replace synth buildup with a string buildup
  - final hook: half-time drums + dramatic string “cathedral moment”

### References (so collaborators aim at the same target)

Use references as _directional anchors_, not as imitation requests:

- **Kanye West — “Dark Fantasy”**: bridge string lift (ceremonial elevation)
- **Runaway film**: strings over the “Power” beat (authority layer over aggression)
- **“Runaway” outro**: catharsis + transformation (useful model for a dramatic final section)

### Hiring sequence (fast + coherent)

You’re buying taste and decision velocity. The clean order:

1. **Producer / co-producer (polish)**: gets the beat skeleton to “mix-ready” and acts as day-to-day taste authority.
2. **Topliner**: develops the hook seed into full topline options. Ask for 2–3 hook candidates in the same emotional lane.
3. **Session vocalists**:
   - male lead for the main vocal narrative
   - female “halo” for stacks, bridge lift, and final-hook sheen (classical technique, pop restraint)
4. **String arranger**: writes to a locked structure; delivers a MIDI mock first; then records live players.
5. **Mix engineer → mastering engineer**
6. **Visuals** (parallel once direction is clear) + bounded marketing assets

Notes:

- **Topliner** usually implies publishing splits. That’s normal. Optimize for the best song and a clean working relationship.
- **Session vocalists** should be work-for-hire with clear deliverables and one defined pickup window.

### Session vocalist “halo” brief (classical-trained, pop-controlled)

- **Tone**: expensive, controlled, intimate (not theatrical)
- **Technique**: excellent intonation; controlled or minimal vibrato on request
- **Role**: “halo,” not featured — supports hook clarity instead of competing for lead space
- **Deliverables**: stacks (low/mid/high), sustained swells, a couple signature bridge lines; dry stems + labeled bounces

### Strings brief (baroque/cinematic maximalism with pop clarity)

Strings are not pads. They are an iconic premium element:

- **Bridge**: tension → lift → inevitability (string buildup replacing synth buildup)
- **Final hook (half-time)**: wide, cinematic, dramatic; frame the hook and the halo vocal
- **Foreground rule**: in any moment, only 1–2 things are truly foreground (usually lead vocal + one signature motif)
- **Register planning**: keep midrange clean for the lead; use highs for shimmer and lows for weight

### Timeline (ASAP, but quality gated)

Default to a timebox with freeze points so “ASAP” doesn’t become endless iteration.

- **Timebox**: 6–10 weeks (8 weeks is a strong default)

**Gate 0 (48 hours): lock the brief + ceiling**

- 1-page creative brief + 3 reference tracks
- budget ceiling + 10–15% contingency
- freeze points (e.g., “no production changes after date X; 2 mix rounds max”)

**Gate 1 (Weeks 1–2): assemble the team**

- lock producer
- lock topliner
- shortlist vocalists + arranger/mixer

**Gate 2 (Weeks 3–5): production lock (“version to mix”)**

- topline decisions made
- vocals tracked/comped enough to arrange confidently
- arrangement locked, tempo map clean, stems organized
- strings: MIDI mock approved → live recording scheduled/executed

**Gate 3 (Weeks 5–7): mix/master + visuals**

- mix: 1–2 rounds, capped
- master: 1 round
- visuals: 1 hero asset + 2–3 cutdowns (bounded)

**Gate 4 (Week 8): release + bounded campaign**

- upload/distributor, release date
- small campaign (finite, not a treadmill)

### Budget allocation (ballpark)

This isn’t a rule, it’s a sanity map to avoid “everything costs $5k” surprise:

- **Production + topline + vocal sessions**: 40–55%
- **Strings (arranger + players + studio)**: 15–25%
- **Mix + master**: 10–20%
- **Visuals**: 10–20%
- **Marketing**: 10–20%
- **Contingency**: 10–15% (included inside the $30k ceiling)

### Marketing without capture (bounded, learning-first)

- Prefer one small, finite campaign over ongoing content pressure.
- Measure only what helps learning (signal), not identity.
- If marketing starts demanding constant output, that’s a cue to reduce scope and authority.

### Closure artifacts to publish (safe, compelling)

- A public closure note: what worked, what didn’t, and the next experiment.
- A sanitized Episode card screenshot (synthetic/redacted).
- The single + a short liner note linking it back to the doctrine: bounded effort, explicit learning, return to baseline.

### Example “learning” to capture (Models)

When you close the Episode, capture explicit beliefs like:

- “Live strings created the biggest perceived-quality jump when reserved for bridge + final hook.”
- “The halo vocal works best as stacks + swells, not as a co-lead.”
- “Two mix rounds cap improved speed and reduced second-guessing without harming quality.”

### Optional: 6–10 line Episode card (fits on a whiteboard)

Use the Operating Manual’s “fits in 6–10 lines” test:

- **TYPE**: Explore — “Release Single: [Working Title]”
- **Hypothesis**: “If we ship one polished, luxury maximalist single with live strings and a bounded rollout, we learn what actually moves perceived quality and response.”
- **Actions (1–3)**: pull from the current Gate you’re in (don’t pre-load)
- **Ends when**: “Single is released + learning captured (Models) + baseline restored”
