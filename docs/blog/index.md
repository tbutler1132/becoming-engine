## About

This blog follows the [amplification plan](../amplification-plan.md): artifacts published episodically, not constantly. Each post should:

- Stand alone (no required reading order)
- Capture explicit learning or clarify doctrine
- Preserve privacy (no real personal state, synthetic examples only)
- Write like a manual, not a manifesto—**legibility over persuasion**

See the amplification plan's "Rung 0: Philosophy" section for guidance on what to publish.
