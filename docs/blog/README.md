# Blog Structure

This folder contains blog posts published according to the [amplification plan](../amplification-plan.md).

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive filenames:

- `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` (e.g., `2025-01-15-baseline-is-the-goal.md`)
- Or just `slug.md` if you prefer (e.g., `baseline-is-the-goal.md`)

## Format

Each post should:

- Be self-contained (no required reading order)
- Include a clear title and date
- Capture explicit learning or clarify doctrine
- Link back to relevant docs (`../doctrine.md`, `../operating-manual.md`, etc.)

## Index

Add new posts to [`index.md`](./index.md) with a brief description.
